      <description>This is a midterm project for MEDIART-206 Computer Graphics.
Environment  openFrameworks v0.11.0  Project Proposal In the midterm project, I plan to design an interactive game that triggers the player to take in-depth thinking around the philosophy of making mistakes.
Inspired by the film Triangle, I plan to use a mechanism that will be different from most 2d adventure games. After the player dies, instead of clearing everything and restart the level, in this game, the player will respawn with their previous bodies that replay their previous operations.</description>

      <description>Demo page for the biological age prediction project led by Prof. Chenkai Wu and his team at Duke Kunshan University. The page receives user&amp;rsquo;s inputs of physiological data and returns with a predicted biological age.
The project is held under Global Health Research Center and funded by local government.
I took the responsibility of server deployment, frontend page design, and the backend system development to connect pre-trained PyCaret model with user&amp;rsquo;s input.</description>
