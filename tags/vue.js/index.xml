      <description>Demo page for the biological age prediction project led by Prof. Chenkai Wu and his team at Duke Kunshan University. The page receives user&amp;rsquo;s inputs of physiological data and returns with a predicted biological age.
The project is held under Global Health Research Center and funded by local government.
I took the responsibility of server deployment, frontend page design, and the backend system development to connect pre-trained PyCaret model with user&amp;rsquo;s input.</description>
